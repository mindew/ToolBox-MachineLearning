questions

1. Generally, the curve shows increasing in accuracy on test set value but the curve is very spikey at first time when I ran it.
2. Around at 20~50%(at first trial), it is spikier than other range of values. There are less data used for testing so when accuracy was calculated it created larger impact on noise.
3. I was able to get fairly smooth curve with logistic regression of 10**-2 and number of trial of 1000
4. Decreasing the power of logistic regression curve gives smoother curve.
